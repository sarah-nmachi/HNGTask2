      <h3>Summary</h3>
 
      <p>Electrical Engineering graduate adept at electrical installations procedures and passion for technology, discovered
         my passion for programming at my volunteer work at TechQuest, I couldn't get enough and started to learn c#. I love
         the combination of both the creative and Logical problem solving part in coding. I am currently looking to intern
         with a software development firm to apply my knowledge to real life projects while learning from more experienced
         developers.

                        I built and deployed a simple Quadratic calculator app during the programme. The app tested that I could
                        convert an algorithm (Quadratic Formula) to code and collect input and provide results to users via an
                        asp.net core web application. The application source code is available on github:
