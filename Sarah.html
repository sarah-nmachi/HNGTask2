  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Electrical Engineering graduate adept at electrical installations procedures and passion for technology, discovered
     my passion for programming at my volunteer work at TechQuest, I couldn't get enough and started to learn c#. I love
     the combination of both the creative and Logical problem solving part in coding. I am currently looking to intern
     with a software development firm to apply my knowledge to real life projects while learning from more experienced
     developers.

          <li>I built and deployed a simple Quadratic calculator app during the programme. The app tested that I could
            convert an algorithm (Quadratic Formula) to code and collect input and provide results to users via an
            asp.net core web application. The application source code is available on github:
